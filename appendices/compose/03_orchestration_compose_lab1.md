# LAB
## Docker Compose

*Lab Objectives*  

This lab demonstrates how to use the Docker Compose feature. There are three examples that build towards an understanding of how to implement several containers using a docker-compose file to manage the deployment.  

Lab Structure - Overview
1.	Compose Hello-World
2.	Install WordPress
3.	Compose Full WordPress Deployment
 

### 1. Compose Hello-World

Step by Step Guide

**Step 1:** Locate the IP address of the Master machine in the lab folder.

**Step 2:** I f on a Mac, or using Linux:  
In a command line, enter  
`ssh -i </Users/â€¦/>docker.pem root@<IP>`
The .pem file will be provided by the instructor for this lab. This command will connect the console to the Docker machine.

*If using Windows: Open Putty and connect to the session you saved earlier.* 
 

**Step 3:** Enter the example1 folder and list the contents. There will be a single docker-compose.yml file inside.  
`cd ./example1` 

`ls`

**Step 4:** Inspect the file docker-compose.yml:  

`cat docker-compose.yml`  
The file is populated as follows:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:

hello-world:
  image: hello-world
```


**Step 5:** Use the `docker-compose up` command with a detach flag to run a hello-world container in the background.

`docker-compose up -d`  

The output will show the hello-world container being created:  
    ```
    Creating network "example1_default" with the default driver
    Creating example1_hello-world_1...done
    ```

**Step 6:** Issue the next command to see the running containers.  

`docker ps`  

The hello-world container should not be listed. This is because it exits upon successfully running. It can be listed by passing the "all" flag.

`docker ps -a`

  You can also use `docker-compose` to interact with containers that are defined in the compose YAML file.  
  List containers: `docker-compose ps`  

**Step 7:** The following command will show the logs that Docker recorded for the hello-world container.  

`docker-compose logs hello-world`

**Step 8:** Enter the following command to remove the container:

`docker-compose down`

**Step 9:** Now, use docker-compose to re-run hello-world in the foreground. Compare the output you see with the logs that Docker recorded for the hello-world container.

**Step 10:** Use the docker-compose down command to clean up the environment

	
### 2. Install WordPress 

Step by Step Guide

**Step 1:** Navigate to the example2 directory and list the contents. There will be a single docker_compose.yml file inside.

`cd ../example2`  

`ls` 

**Step 2:** This Docker compose file is designed to set up a small WordPress deployment. 

`docker-compose up -d`  

The output will show the WordPress container being created:  
```text
Creating network "example2_default" with the default driver
Creating example1_wordpress_1
```

**Step 3:** Enter:

`docker-compose ps`  

Take note of the port that is listed for the WordPress container (8080).

**Step 4:** Navigate to the Master_IP.  

`http://<Master_IP>:8080`

If you don't see the expected install page, review the status and the logs of the WordPress container. Is there an evident problem?  

**Step 5:** Back in the console window, enter 

`vim docker-compose.yml`

Delete the comment marks from in front of the MySQL container by moving the cursor down and using the `x` key to delete each `#` character. After deleting the comment marks, save and exit vim via `esc` `:wq`

**Step 6:** Enter:

`docker-compose up -d` 

The output will show the WordPress container starting up, and the new MySQL container being created.

```yaml
Starting example2_wordpress_1
Creating example2_mysql_1
```

**Step 7:** After a few moments, the WordPress Installer will be available at `http://<Master_IP>:8080`.
in the web browser.

**Step 8:** Enter:

`docker-compose stop` 

This will only stop the containers from running, it will not remove them. Enter the following to validate they are still on the machine: 

`docker ps -a`

**Step 9:** Use vim to edit the docker-compose.yml file so that WordPress is exposed on port `8082` of the host. After making your edits, restart the application in detached mode and confirm the change using a web browser. 

**Step 10:** List the available Docker networks, and identify the network being used by the WordPress application. Can you explain the derivation of the name of this network? (Hint: `docker network ls`)

**Step 11:** Stop and remove the containers:

`docker-compose down`

**Step 12:** 	Recheck the networks in Docker. Is the application network still available?
	
`docker network ls`

### 3. Compose Full WordPress Deployment

Step by Step Guide

**Step 1:** Navigate to the example3 directory and list the contents. There will be a single docker_compose.yml file inside.

`cd ../example3`  

`ls`

**Step 1:** Inspect the Docker Compose file.

`cat docker-compose.yml`

Take a few moments to answer the following questions to yourself:

* Identify the volumes that are being created.
* What is the driver for the mariadb data volume?
* There are two services: mariadb and wordpress. Which one will be instantiated first?

If you are having trouble answering these questions, ask the instructor for help.


**Step 2:** Enter:

`docker-compose up -d`  

This may take a few minutes to pull the full WordPress deployment.

**Step 3:** Verify that the containers are running:

`docker-compose ps`

**Step 4:** Navigate to `http://<MASTER_IP>/wp-admin` in the web browser.  

**Step 5:** Log in to WordPress with the following credentials:  

    `Username: user`  
    `Password: bitnami`  

**Step 6:** On the Dashboard page, under At a Glance, click on the Post link

**Step 7:** Edit the Hello World! post.

**Step 8:** Make any changes to the post on this page and click Update when finished.

**Step 8:** Navigate to  `http://<MASTER_IP>` in another web browser tab. The page that loads should be the WordPress blog with the updated post.

**Step 9:** Now, find the ID of the WordPress application container and make a note of it. Stop and remove the container. Confirm that the WordPress site is no longer available.

**Step 10:** List the available Docker volumes. Did removing the WordPress application container affect any volumes? (Hint: `docker volume ls`)

**Step 11:** Restore the application configuration using the docker-compose up command in detached mode. 

**Step 12** Navigate back to the WordPress site in a web browser tab. Do you see the changes you made to the Hello World post in Step 8? Why or why not?

**Step 13** Back in the console window, stop and remove the application using docker-compose. Check the list of available Docker volumes. Has the list changed?

**Step 14** Use the -v flag to docker-compose down to remove the volumes listed in the compose file: 

`docker-compose down -v`  

**Step 15** Recheck the Docker volume list after the command has run.

`docker volume ls`
